This file describes relative files of NFD.

basic_classes.h && basic_classes.cpp: declare and define the fundamental classes used in NFD framework.

basic_methods.cpp: defines some methods could be used.

decode.h: define some basic network data stuctures.

Above files may be included or combined into onvm, but I am afraid that the C++-features would make this process troublesome.
